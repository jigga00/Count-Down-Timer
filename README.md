This web application is a live countdown timer that tracks the time remaining until a specific date — in this case, a One Year Anniversary on May 30, 2025. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it displays the remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds in a visually appealing and responsive layout.
The app features a full-screen background image, a centered title, and four animated countdown boxes that update every second in real-time. It’s lightweight, customizable, and ideal for events, anniversaries, product launches, or special occasions.
